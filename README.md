# JankyFinalProject

This is my final project submission for sem1 of highschool cs  class. My code includes a **hybrid of Java, C, and Python**. The reason the UI and most of the components are made in java is due to the fact that **the majority of the visable code must be prorammed in Java to satisfy the submission requirements**. 


## Deployment

To run this project:

```bash
  run the java file called RUNME.java
```


## Features

- Fully functional and **asthetic UI** built with **java**
- A **game** custom built with **C**
- A **"new" programming language** called Prava (parody of java) built with **python** 
- A lot of work
